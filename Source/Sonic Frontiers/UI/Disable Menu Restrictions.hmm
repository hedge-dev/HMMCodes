Patch "Disable Menu Restrictions" in "UI" by "Hyper" does
/*
Removes restrictions from accessing certain menu screens and options.

Notes;
- This grants you the full pause menu, including the Skills and Save Data menus, within reasonable areas (e.g. the tutorial).
- This grants you permission to save and load anywhere, including during combat.
- This will allow you to open the map screen during combat.
- This will allow you to place map markers before having completed any challenges.
- This will allow you to enter Photo Mode during inaccessible parts of the game where Photo Mode is usually accessible.
