Code "Disable Super Sonic Damage Wait" in "Gameplay" by "Hyper" does
/*
Disables Super Sonic remaining uncontrollable for a short period after taking heavy damage from the titans.

Notes;
- This does not affect Wyvern, as the knock back damage doesn't cause any major inconvenience there, and disabling it only makes the camera look bad.
- It is recommended to use this with the "Disable Super Sonic Damage Camera" code.
