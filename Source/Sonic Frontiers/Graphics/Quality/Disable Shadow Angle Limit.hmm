Patch "Disable Shadow Angle Limit" by "Hyper & GamingLeroy" in "Graphics/Quality" does 
/*
Disables the limit that prevents long shadows from being drawn against parallel global light.

In simpler terms, shadows will line up correctly with the sun and moon.

This will be particularly noticeable during sunrise and sunset hours.

    /*
        The game has a strange optimisation that loads the RFL struct
        we're modifying into the FPU as xmmwords, so 16 bytes at a time.

        This hook is a *hack* that checks the last entry in the xmmword
        before it gets written to the xmm0 register, which we then replace
        with zero if equal to 50.0f.

        The value in RAX is different per cycle of this function (it is
        run every frame), so we must check this value first to verify
        we're modifying the right struct before writing to it.

        All islands use a value of 50.0f for "minLightElevationAngle",
        so checking for this is not an issue (other than when people
        change this value for their own use, but it's better not to
        force this change for user values anyway).
