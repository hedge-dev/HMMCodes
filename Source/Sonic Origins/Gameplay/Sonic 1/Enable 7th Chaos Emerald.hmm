/*
Enables the 7th Chaos Emerald in normal gameplay, allowing the player to use Super forms once all seven are collected.

Notes;
- The game does not check the emeralds setting when checking if the player should transform, so collecting all seven emeralds in a save file will allow the player to transform regardless of whether or not this code is enabled.
